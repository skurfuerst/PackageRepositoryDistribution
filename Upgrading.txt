UPGRADING INSTRUCTIONS
----------------------

This file contains instructions for upgrading your FLOW3 1.0 beta 2 installation
to FLOW3 1.0.0.

GIT SUBMODULES
--------------

Git repository URLs have changed, because we renamed the repositories to include
the vendor name. You can update by simply pulling the distribution itself and then
running "git submodule sync". This will update the remote URLs in the submodule
folders themselves.

ANNOTATION SYNTAX
-----------------

The syntax for annotations has changed, they are now case-sensitive and namespaced.

A migration script is provided, backup your custom source code and then run
 Packages/Framework/TYPO3.FLOW3/Scripts/migrate-annotations.php

Look at the changes the script makes and you should be able to understand most of
what you need to know about the new annotations.
